## Tools Used
- SIEM: Splunk Enterprise
- Log Sources:
  - Windows Security Event Logs
  - Sysmon
  - DNS logs
  - Firewall / network logs
- Endpoint OS: Windows 10 / Windows Server
- Attacker Simulation:
  - Brute-force authentication attempts
  - Phishing payload execution
  - PowerShell abuse
  - Credential dumping simulation

## Data Handling
- No real production data
- No real user credentials
- All IPs, usernames, and domains are simulated

## Purpose
To demonstrate SOC alert triage, detection engineering, incident response, and threat hunting skills in a controlled environment.
