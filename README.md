# SOC Analyst Detection Portfolio

## Overview
This repository demonstrates hands-on Security Operations Center (SOC) experience aligned with
enterprise and U.S. federal cybersecurity operations. It showcases practical skills in alert triage,
SIEM detection engineering, incident response, threat hunting, MITRE ATT&CK mapping, SOC metrics,
and operational documentation.

All content is structured to reflect **real-world SOC workflows** commonly used in:
- Federal civilian agencies
- Department of Defense (DoD) environments
- Government contractors
- Managed Security Service Providers (MSSPs)

This portfolio emphasizes **operational readiness, repeatability, and documentation quality** —
key expectations in regulated and mission-driven environments.

---

## Why This Portfolio Exists
The purpose of this repository is to simulate the **day-to-day responsibilities of a SOC analyst**
supporting enterprise or federal systems. Rather than isolated labs, this portfolio demonstrates:

- End-to-end alert triage and escalation decisions
- Detection engineering with false-positive analysis
- Incident investigations with documented findings
- MITRE ATT&CK–aligned detection coverage
- SOC playbooks and response procedures
- Metrics used to assess SOC effectiveness and maturity

All artifacts are designed to reflect **how work is actually performed in a production SOC**.

## Repository Navigation
The repository is organized by SOC functional areas:

- **Alert-Triage** 
  Initial alert analysis, validation logic, prioritization, and disposition decisions.

- **Incident-Reports** 
  Documented investigations including scope determination, evidence analysis,
  root cause assessment, and response actions.

- **Detection-Engineering** 
  SIEM detection logic, detection design methodology, and false-positive tuning.

- **Detection-Coverage** 
  Detection coverage matrices mapped to the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

- **Splunk-Detections** 
  SPL-based detections for common adversary behaviors such as privilege escalation,
  suspicious process execution, and abuse of administrative tools.

- **Threat-Hunting** 
  Hypothesis-driven hunts aligned to known adversary techniques and behaviors.

- **SOC-Playbooks** 
  Standardized response procedures for common security incidents.

- **SOC-Metrics** 
  Key performance indicators (KPIs) and measurements used to evaluate SOC performance
  and operational health.

- **Dashboards** 
  Conceptual SOC dashboard designs for visibility into alerts, incidents, and trends.

- **SOAR** 
  Automation concepts and workflows for alert enrichment and response.

- **MITRE-Mappings** 
  Explicit mappings between detections, incidents, and ATT&CK techniques.

- **Resume-Mapping** 
  Direct traceability between resume bullet points and supporting evidence within
  this repository.

- **Lab-Environment** 
  Description of the lab environment used to generate alerts, detections, and incidents.

## Federal / DoD Relevance
This portfolio emphasizes principles commonly required in federal and DoD environments:
- Documentation quality and audit readiness
- Repeatable and defensible detection logic
- ATT&CK-aligned coverage and reporting
- Clear separation of triage, investigation, and response
- Metrics-driven SOC performance evaluation

Artifacts are written in a manner suitable for **security reviews, inspections, and compliance-driven operations**.

## Resume Alignment
Each resume bullet point is intentionally mapped to supporting evidence in this repository.
Reviewers can validate claimed experience by navigating to the corresponding folder or document.

This approach ensures transparency, traceability, and technical credibility.
