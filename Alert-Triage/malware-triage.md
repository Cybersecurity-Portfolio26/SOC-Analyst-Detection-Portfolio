# Malware Alert Triage Guide

## Purpose
This document defines the Tier-1 SOC workflow for validating and triaging malware alerts,
gathering context, assessing scope, and determining escalation.

Tier-1 analysts are responsible for **verification, analysis, documentation, and escalation** —
not malware removal or system remediation.

---

## Alert Sources
Malware alerts may originate from:
- Endpoint Detection & Response (EDR)
- Antivirus / Malware Protection platforms
- SIEM correlation rules
- Email Security Gateways
- User-reported suspicious activity

---

## Step 1: Alert Validation
Confirm the alert is legitimate and relevant.

### Validation Checks
- Alert timestamp is current
- Host is active and reachable
- Detection source is reliable
- Alert is not part of testing or maintenance

**Outcome**
- Invalid / expected activity → Close
- Valid alert → Continue triage

---

## Step 2: Initial Context Gathering
Collect essential details to understand the event.

### Required Information
- Hostname
- Username
- Process name
- File name and full file path
- Detection signature or rule name

---

## Step 3: File Reputation Analysis
Determine whether the detected file is known malicious.

### Actions
- Identify file hash (SHA-256 preferred)
- Perform reputation lookup using threat intelligence sources

### Possible Outcomes
- Known malicious → Escalate
- Unknown / low reputation → Continue investigation
- Known benign → Close with documentation

---

## Step 4: Execution Analysis
Review how the file was executed.

### Indicators to Review
- Parent process (e.g., `WINWORD.EXE`, `OUTLOOK.EXE`)
- Command-line arguments (encoded or obfuscated commands)
- Execution directory (`Temp`, `AppData`, user profile paths)

**Suspicious Indicators**
- Office applications spawning scripting engines
- Encoded PowerShell commands
- Execution from non-standard directories

---

## Step 5: Network Activity Review
Determine if post-execution network communication occurred.

### Review Questions
- Did the process initiate outbound connections?
- Are destination IPs or domains external?
- Is communication repetitive or beacon-like?

**Indicators of Concern**
- Connections to low-reputation domains
- Regular outbound traffic patterns

---

## Step 6: Scope Assessment
Identify whether the activity is isolated or widespread.

### Scope Checks
- Same file hash observed on other hosts
- Similar activity by the same user
- Indicators of lateral movement

---

## Step 7: Decision Matrix

| Finding | Action |
|------|------|
| Benign or expected activity | Close |
| Suspicious behavior, no confirmed impact | Monitor and document |
| Confirmed malware execution | Escalate |

---

## Step 8: Escalation Criteria
Escalate to Tier-2 if any of the following are observed:
- Known malicious file hash
- Command-and-control communication
- Multiple affected hosts
- Privileged account involved
- Office macro-based execution

---

## Documentation Requirements
Each alert must include:
- Summary of findings
- Evidence collected
- Decision rationale
- Analyst notes and timestamps

---

## MITRE ATT&CK Mapping
Common techniques associated with malware alerts:
- T1059 – Command and Scripting Interpreter
- T1105 – Ingress Tool Transfer
- T1566 – Phishing (if email origin)

---

## Example Triage Summary
> Malware alert detected on workstation FIN-WS-014. 
> PowerShell execution observed with encoded command spawned from Microsoft Word. 
> External network communication identified. 
> Alert escalated to Tier-2 for containment and response.

---

## Tier-1 Analyst Notes
- Do not attempt remediation or host isolation without authorization
- Focus on accuracy, scope determination, and documentation
- Escalate when impact or compromise is suspected
